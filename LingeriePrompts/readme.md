# Flux Lingerie Understanding and Customization Grid

## Introduction
This repository contains the results of a large-scale image generation test to evaluate the capabilities of Flux in understanding and customizing lingerie designs. The primary goal was to identify how well Flux can generate symmetrical details and accurate representations based on a variety of prompts.

## Project Details
- **Image Dimensions:** 512x768
- **Total Images:** Over 1300
- **Image Processing:** Each image was processed using a 4060 TI 16GB graphics card with an average processing time of nearly 4 minutes for 2mp images.
- **Software Used:** SwarmUI/ComfyUI with minimal customization.
- **Prompting:** All prompts were generated by ChatGPT and vary in specificity and clarity.

## Repository Structure
Each folder within this repository represents a single prompt, containing all images generated for that specific prompt. Image metadata is included for each image, providing details on the generation settings and outcomes.

## Key Findings
- **Symmetry:** Flux has shown considerable improvement in maintaining symmetry, especially noticeable in elements like buttons and lace patterns.
- **Accuracy in Garment Representation:** While many garments were accurately generated, there is a significant number that did not meet expectations, indicating room for improvement.
- **Image Resolution and Detailing:** Higher resolution images (1152x1728 with 35 steps) showed better results in capturing intricate details like lace and embroidery compared to the smaller images used in this test.

## Takeaways
The findings suggest that while Flux is capable of generating detailed and symmetrical lingerie designs, there is variability in its effectiveness depending on the resolution and complexity of the images. Further testing with higher resolution images may enhance the accuracy and detailing of the outputs.
