# Flux - How well does it do wild and crazy clothing

## Description

So I initially started this test at 512x768, but found that Flux actually performed markedly better with many of these prompts at a higher resolution.  I ended up sticking with the SDXL standard 1MP 832x1216 because while 2MP got me slightly better results, we would have been waiting all week for this to generate at 2MP.  

Overall I feel it did a pretty exceptional job.  There are some clear spot on hits (Looking at you meat dress) and some that just didn't hit the mark.  I will give it cudos for not putting nipples on all the female armor.

So if you are in the need of your models wearing a spoon hat, Flux has got you covered.  Just hope you don't need them to wear Sandpaper because it clearly missed the mark there.
