# Flux AI Female Ethnicity Prompt Comparisons

## Description

This repository documents a series of experiments conducted using the Flux1-dev-fp8 model on SwarmUI/ComfyUI to generate images of females of specific ethnicities. The primary goal is to evaluate the model's accuracy and variation in facial and pose generation based on ethnicity prompts.

This project serves as a basic test using straightforward prompts requesting images of persons from specified ethnicities. For a related test using national origins instead of ethnicities, refer to the main root of this repository.  You can also find a similar test using males.

### Performance Overview

While Flux AI performs reasonably well with the ethnicity prompts, there are noticeable limitations in facial variation and pose dynamics, which were somewhat disappointing.

## Test Notes

- **Resolution:** All images tested at 512x768
- **Model:** Flux1-dev-fp8
- **Platform:** SwarmUI/ComfyUI
- **Steps:** 25 per image generation
