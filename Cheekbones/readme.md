# Flux - Usage of Cheekbone Prompting in Facial Variation Testing

## Description

For this test I tried to utilize two people posed together with a simple prompt that included their cheekbones.  I will also be doing tests with overall face shape, eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, and a variety of randomized complex prompts.  See the root of this repository for folders matching those tests as I am able to finish and publish them.

## Testing Details

- **Image Resolution:** 512x768
- **Model:** Flux1-dev-fp8
- **Hardware:** 4060 TI 16GB
- **Software:** SwarmUI + ComfyUI

## Notes

Overall, this was an intriguing test. Significant variation based on cheekbones alone wasn't anticipated. However, it was impressive to observe that the model could somewhat understand the concept, even if not all prompts were successfully interpreted.
