# Flux - How well does it do with various poses

## Description

Like most of my tests I have kept the prompt as simple as possible to try and isolate just the element I want, the posing.  Overall I am pretty happy with how well it did.  While it did have a few complete misses and some rather painful looking deformaties.  It also managed to get several of them very right.  SD3 - You might want to take some pointers on woman lying in the grass here.

It seems to have a significant issue with any position that would put a person inverted and curved.  So belly up, head and feet down.  It also had issues with diving prompts and getting the goggles on his forehead.  And why does the Javelin guy always have a bow?

I'm going to give it a B- here and it might get a B with some additional prompt refinement.

Can't wait to see what Flux2 can do, right after I invest $30,000 in a graphics card that can handle it. :)
