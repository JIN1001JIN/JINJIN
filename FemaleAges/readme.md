# Flux - Usage of Age in Prompting

## Description

Overall I suppose it did a decent job with age progression.  Although apparently the difference between 45 and 50 is drastic.  This is bad news for me.  On the flip side maybe my aging will cease when I hit 75.  This test is one where the facial affinity of Flux is actually a benefit.
