# Flux AI Male Nationality Prompt Comparisons

## Description

This repository documents a series of experiments conducted using the Flux1-dev-fp8 model on SwarmUI/ComfyUI to generate images of males of specific nationalities. The primary goal is to evaluate the model's accuracy and variation in facial and pose generation based on nationality prompts.

This project serves as a basic test using straightforward prompts requesting images of persons from specified nationalities.  Look at the main repo folder for other tests including this test done with females.

### Performance Overview

While Flux AI performs reasonably well with the nationality prompts, there are noticeable limitations in facial variation and pose dynamics, which were somewhat disappointing.

## Test Notes

- **Resolution:** All images tested at 512x768
- **Model:** Flux1-dev-fp8
- **Platform:** SwarmUI/ComfyUI
- **Steps:** 25 per image generation
