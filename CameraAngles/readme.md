# Flux - Usage of Camera Angle in Prompting

## Description

Overall it managed to get several of the angles correct.  There were some that it didn't get right, but that's the be expected.  Since I am using ChatGPT to create the prompts it's also highly likely it hallucinated some angle that nobody would actually use.  It's also possible that some angles would be better with different positioning in the prompt.
